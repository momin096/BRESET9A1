    <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of web
        pages. It allows web designers and developers to separate content from design, enhancing the visual appeal and
        user experience of websites. CSS defines how HTML elements should be displayed, including aspects such as
        colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.</p>

    <p> CSS operates on a set of rules composed of selectors and declarations. Selectors target specific HTML elements,
        while declarations consist of property-value pairs that define the styles to be applied. For example, `h1 {
        color: blue; font-size: 24px; }` styles all `
    <h1>` elements with blue text and a font size of 24 pixels.</p>

        <p>One of CSS's powerful features is its cascading nature, which allows multiple styles to be applied to an
            element, with specific rules determining which styles take precedence. CSS also supports responsive design
            through media queries, enabling websites to adapt to various screen sizes and devices.</p>

        <p>With frameworks like Bootstrap and preprocessors like SASS, CSS has evolved to offer more advanced styling
            capabilities. As a core technology of the web alongside HTML and JavaScript, CSS is essential for creating
            modern, visually engaging websites.</p>
